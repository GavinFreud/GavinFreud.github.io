            <td>Found it very difficult to understand how to use, particularly because my Javascript itself was rusty.
              While it's a very useful skill, I think i'm better off not trying to cram this into 20 hours along with
              several other subskills.</td>

            <td>Attempt to draw artistic assets and compose a short musical piece.</td>
            <td>Trying to draw art was a challenge due to my lack of artistic ability. With the use of some tutorials, I
              could see myself improving, but the real challenge came to reproducing them as assets. I tried to use GIMP
              to try and draw, but this proved to be really difficult with just the mouse, which caused lots of issues.
              Trying to crop a scanned image also proved to be difficult once again with the use of a mouse. I was
              trying to draw a tree, but then I found a better drawn tree on the internet that I could use without
              royalties. For music, software is unbelievably complicated. I wanted to try using Ableton Live, and was
              able to procure a copy through a free trial. Getting used to the interface seems like it could take 20
              hours on its own, and then learning how to record instruments on top of that could be exceedingly
              complicated as well.</td>

            <td>Acquaint myself with Howler.js and relearn some JS</td>
            <td>The JS wasn't too hard to relearn, considering I took CS1520 (Programming Languages for Web
              Applications) last semester, but it was definitely good that I did. Around 45 minutes was spent trying to
              get Howler to work on my computer, but I realized that I didn't properly import it using script tags. On
              the bright side, I was able to understand how to use howler pretty quickly and messed around a bit working
              with various songs that I have on my computer.</td>

            <td>Write some drafts using streamwriting</td>
            <td>I spent an hour and 15 minutes using Leonardo Da Vinci's streamwriting technique to write 4 full-page
              drafts and 1 half-page draft. This was surprisingly useful, as even though most of my ideas across drafts
              weren't particularly coherent, they still had some reasonably interesting ideas. I saved them and decided
              to try to make the shorter half-page draft into a small interactive piece. I wanted to get it done within
              an hour, and was able to do it within around 45 minutes. That can be found <a href="practice/">here.</a>
