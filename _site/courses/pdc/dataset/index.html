    <h3>Part 1: Introduction</h3>
    <p>
        Occasionally, I like to take a stroll around Pittsburgh. While there may not be much greenery at Pitt (aside from the Schenley Quad and the Cathedral Lawn), there is quite a bit to be found at Schenley Park down the road. 
        While I'm there, much of my time is taken admiring the scenery and analyzing the different kinds of flora and fauna that I see. With that being said, it probably isn't too much of a surprise that I chose a dataset about the different kind of trees to talk about for this project.
    </p>
    <p>
        Nature is something that isn't as static as we would like to think it is. Much like people, animals, and diseases, flora and fauna tend to spread and move across the globe. Whether this be through exchange through arboretums, 
        exchange facilitated by human necessity (exchange of plants and trees producing specific vegetables and fruits, perhaps), or maybe even by accident, we see a large number of trees and plants around us that may not have always been there.
        My objective for today is to see what trees are indeed indigenous to Pittsburgh, and then see if the population is more biased towards those species or towards the introduced trees.
        However, let's start by taking a look at the trees that are indigenous to Pennsylvania, and just how many there are now.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Part 2: "I don't need to take this, I'm indigenous!" - Every tree in Schenley Park</h3>
    <p>
        After a quick google search, you'll find that many websites in fact don't have much information on what trees are indigenous to PA and which aren't. Some websites will state that there are only around 4-10 trees that originated in PA <sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>, while others state that there are over 40<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup>. 
        However, through these websites we can definitely find common ground. For the most part, it appears that Pine trees and Balsam Firs are agreed to be indigenous to PA as a whole, while other common finds were Maple and Oak trees.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, that's not really why we're here. All we care about is Pittsburgh, and nowhere else. Thankfully, there is a Popular Pittsburgh article that talks about trees commonly found in Pittsburgh<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup>, but not particularly ones that are indigenous to Pittsburgh. However, we can correlate the 
        one mentioned in the Popular Pittsburgh article to the trees listed in the previous articles to find which trees are (or at least have a high probability of being) indigenous to Pittsburgh. With that strategy in mind, here are a few trees that are indigenous to Pittsburgh:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Birch trees</li>
        <li>Dogwood trees</li>
        <li>Maple trees</li>
        <li>Pine trees</li>
        <li>Sycamore trees</li>
        <li>Eastern Hemlock trees</li>
        <li>White Oak trees</li>
        <li>Elm trees</li> 
    </ul>
    <p>
        Interestingly enough, the only trees that were on the Popular Pittsburgh list but weren't on the iNaturalist website<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup> were the Tree of Heaven and Poplar trees. The Tree of Heaven is a tree that has been introduced to PA, and is wreaking havoc on many an ecosystem here (fun fact, the computer science class called 
        "Introduction to Computer Game Design" actually started as a way to train potential grad students in special skills that would be useful when working on a project to monitor the Tree of Heaven population in the US). Poplar trees are more interesting, particularly because they are indigenous to the northern hemisphere and I've seen many
        when wandering parks in Philadelphia, so it was a surprise not to see them included in the trees indigenous to PA.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Part 3: Data? Oh right, <em>that</em> data...</h3>
    <p>
        Alright, now that we have an idea on what kind of trees are indigenous to Pittsburgh, let's take a look at what the dataset that I found (courtesy of the City of Pittsburgh Department of Public Works Forestry Division). The dataset itself is very detailed, with many different measures and dimensions that we could look at. We could look
        at the land use, Carbon Dioxide Benefits, and a variety of other different points, but the only thing of interest to us is the count of each type of tree that this data set has. After plugging it into Tableau, this is what we get:
    </p>

                    style='border: none' /></a></noscript><object class='tableauViz' style='display:none;'>

            <param name='filter' value='publish=yes' /></object>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>
        There's quite a bit to extract from this, despite it being such a simple bar graph. Right off the bat, we can definitely see a large presence of Maple trees in the dataset.
        This does invite some speculation as to whether or not the maple tree is so abundant in Pittsburgh because it's indigenous to Pittsburgh or not, but there is actually more interesting information present on the page.
    </p>
    <p>
        One thing of note that I need to mention is that I restricted the representation in that visualization down to specific trees that were over 500 in number within Pittsburgh. With that being said, is there anything interesting 
        about the data that is available in the visualization? Anything striking at all? 
    </p>
    <p>
        Those are the same questions that I asked myself when looking at it, and quite a bit of pieces of information surprised me. Something in particular that I wanted to 
        investigate further however, is the reason for the large number of foreign trees in Pittsburgh. If you look toward the sides of the graph, you'll notice quite a few species from East Asia, particularly the Ginkgo trees, Japanese Lilac trees, and Japanese Zelkovas. It's also worth
        noting that several of the most represented trees on the visualization are also foreign, including the London planetree, Callery Pear tree, and the Littleleaf Linden trees. This led me to wonder about some of their origins, and whether or not their existence is anything significant in Pittsburgh.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Part 4: Treehuggers</h3>

    <p>
        In my search for information regarding these different species, I was inevitably led to <a href="https://www.treepittsburgh.org/">Tree Pittsburgh's website</a>. Tree Pittsburgh is an organization within Pittsburgh that aims to cultivate and maintain a healthy urban forest by 
        spearheading and encouraging participation in events within the Pittsburgh community to plant, maintain and protect trees. It was through their website that I ended up finding useful information regarding some of their work, which pertains to some of our out-of-place friends.
    </p>
    <p>
        This talk about the dataset as well as about Tree Pittsburgh finally brings me to talk about the Ginkgo tree. Yes, that tree in the visualization that happens to have a population of over 600 trees in Pittsburgh despite being native to China. While we're not quite sure how they got to Pittsburgh,
        we do know a few things. First, they are very tolerant and capable of thriving in an urban environment (which is why they do so well in Pittsburgh). Secondly, they produce a fruit that smells terrible, at least such a scent that most people in Pittsburgh absolutely despise, to the point of calling 
        311 on a regular basis to get the fruits cleaned<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup>.
    </p>
    <p>
        This was something that the good people over at Tree Pittsburgh were not willing to let sit with them, however. In 2015, they organized the first ever Ginkgo Fest, a one-day festival meant to celebrate everything that is the Ginkgo tree<sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup>. They measured the tallest Ginkgo tree, held book readings and origami sessions, 
        and overall ran an event meant to grace the Pittsburgh public with love surrounding the Ginkgo tree. As of this article's publication, there has been no other Ginkgo Fest since 2015, but I hope that changes in the future.
    </p>
    <br></br>
    <h3>Part 5: Conclusion...or would "tl;dr" be a better section title?</h3>
    <p>
        Now that we reach the end of the article, many of you are probably wondering, "what did I just read?" I wouldn't particularly blame you, as we've had a long journey. We first started off this article with the determination to determine whether or not indigenous trees out-represented foreign trees. From there, we went on to gather 
        information as to which trees in Pittsburgh are indeed indigenous to Pittsburgh. After plotting the data, we then completely changed course and tried to track down where some of the more interesting tree species came from. From there, we ran into Tree Pittsburgh, and discovered their wholesome mission and wonderful effort at ingratiating the Ginkgo
        tree to the Pittsburgh populace.
    </p>
    <p>
        What I'm trying to say is that the moral of the story is that almost everything around you has a story to tell, whether or not it's one exciting incident or a long journey composed of tiny, seemingly uneventful vignettes. Either way, thinking about things that may seem minute or meaningless at first may yield something interesting. Thanks for reading!
