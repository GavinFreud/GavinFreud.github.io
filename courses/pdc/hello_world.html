    <h1>Objectively Awesome: Fork Bombs</h1>
    <h4>Hey Ram, what the fork is a Fork Bomb?</h4>
    
    <p>Excellent question. Let me ask you another one. Are you familiar with Australia's Cane Toad Infestation? If not, 
        here's a quick refresher. In the 1930's, Australia introduced a family of Cane Toads to the island in order to 
        control the rampantly growing grey-backed Cane beetle population. The toads did NOT do this, and instead became 
        their own menace to Australia. Australians still have to deal with Cane toads to this day.

        You are probably wondering, "Ram, what does this have to do with Fork Bombs?" Well, kind of everything. To bit it
        simply, Fork Bombs are exactly like what happened in Australia, except they're happening in your machines with CPU
        processes rather than toads (I can't even <em>imagine</em> what it would be like to have <strong>TOADS</strong> in your computer).

    <div class="content">To see an example of a fork bomb, look at this UNIX shell input:
        <br>
        <br>
    </div>
    <code>:(){ :|:& };:</code>
        <br>
        <br>
    <p>A quick explanation of what's happening here: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>First, an explanation of each snippet of that command: </li>
        <ul>
            <li><code>:()</code> - This statement is defining some random function where our code will live </li>
            <li><code>{</code> - Begins the function, everything within this and its sister bracket will determine what happens</li>
            <li><code>:</code> - Loads a copy of the function that we are currently defining into memory </li>
            <li><code>|</code> - This signifies that the output of the function copy we loaded in previously is being piped
                to...</li>
            <li><code>:</code> - ...Another copy of the function that we're defining</li>
            <li><code>&</code> - This signifies that the statements that were declared to the immediate left of it should still
                be run in the background even after this command has been terminated</li>
            <li><code>}</code> - This ends the function that we just defined</li>
            <li><code>;</code> - This ends our declaration of the function</li>
            <li><code>:</code> - Us calling the function we just defined. This begins the chaos that we have been orchestrating
                before this.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Whenever you type that command into your UNIX shell, you are starting a chain reaction of endless, worthless functions that exist only to generate two more like it.</li>
        <li>This leads to these processes crowding your CPU with so many meaningless tasks that it will begin to hinder its ability to do actual work that you need it to do.</li>
        <li>Only way to fix this is to reboot your computer. Not bad, but could be deadly if you need to save a ton of files. Long story short, try not to fall for this :).</li>
    </ul>
