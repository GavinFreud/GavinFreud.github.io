              While it's a very useful skill, I think i'm better off not trying to cram this into 20 hours along with
              several other subskills.</td>

            <td>Trying to draw art was a challenge due to my lack of artistic ability. With the use of some tutorials, I
              could see myself improving, but the real challenge came to reproducing them as assets. I tried to use GIMP
              to try and draw, but this proved to be really difficult with just the mouse, which caused lots of issues.
              Trying to crop a scanned image also proved to be difficult once again with the use of a mouse. I was
              trying to draw a tree, but then I found a better drawn tree on the internet that I could use without
              royalties. For music, software is unbelievably complicated. I wanted to try using Ableton Live, and was
              able to procure a copy through a free trial. Getting used to the interface seems like it could take 20
              hours on its own, and then learning how to record instruments on top of that could be exceedingly
              complicated as well.</td>

            <td>The JS wasn't too hard to relearn, considering I took CS1520 (Programming Languages for Web
              Applications) last semester, but it was definitely good that I did. Around 45 minutes was spent trying to
              get Howler to work on my computer, but I realized that I didn't properly import it using script tags. On
              the bright side, I was able to understand how to use howler pretty quickly and messed around a bit working
              with various songs that I have on my computer.</td>

            <td>Write some drafts using streamwriting</td>
            <td>I spent an hour and 15 minutes using Leonardo Da Vinci's streamwriting technique to write and edit 4 full-page
              drafts and 1 half-page draft. This was surprisingly useful, as even though most of my ideas across drafts
              weren't particularly coherent, they still had some reasonably interesting ideas. I saved them and decided
              to try to make the shorter half-page draft into a small interactive piece (greatly cut down due to JS troubles). 
              I wanted to get it done within an hour, and was able to do it within around 45 minutes. That can be found

              <td>I started working on my final Pages Content. I decided to change gears for the final project and 
                instead wanted to work towards a story where you work with an interactive 'terminal' (essentially a digital version of Tom Riddle's 
                Diary from the second Harry Potter novel). It took me some time to get used to Typed.js' documentation, and 
                trying to incorporate Howler.js along with it took some time. I figured it out, and also started working on CSS
                to set the background something like a terminal and changed some of the text as well. This was a decent start to my project.

            <td>Whole lots of Javascript, some tweaks to the writing</td>
            <td>Today I started trying to work on the small project that I had before. I wanted to include some choice and consequence, so I decided
              to have Javascript generate ul's with li's that would serve as the options. This was my original goal, and it did eventually become a reality,
              but the first part of my session for today was spent trying to handle a few annoyances with Typed.js. One particular issue is that Typed.js is 
              handled primarily by callbacks. Callbacks weren't something that I really had much experience with in Javascript, so it took a little bit of time 
              to figure out how they really worked. While I saw and tested many solutions online that handled this, particularly setting timeouts and nesting callback
              functions together, I realized that since Typed.js has an "onComplete" attribute which allows me to run a function once the animation has completed,
              I could just have it generate the next part of the story that way. I spent a decent amount of time trying to handle callbacks, and the rest of my practice 
              was dedicated to fleshing out different paths that the user could go down interacting with Walden. Unfortunately, due to my various difficulties I couldn't have
              several winding paths like I expected, and instead ended up plotting a a few smaller paths.

            <td>Asking Webapps Professor for help on gradients, finishing story</td>
            <td>For one part of my project, I wanted to be able to change the background from one gradient to a much whackier gradient. Since I got
              the first gradient from the internet, I wasn't really sure how they worked, and I couldn't figure out how to get Javascript to change the background
              of the body to that of a different gradient. Because of this, I decided to go to my Web Development professor's office hours. That being said, I got really nervous
              because I wasn't used to asking for help, and he ended up noticing me outside and invited me in. It turns out that while my intuition of how to declare a gradient was 
              correct, I wasn't actually changing the body background correctly. From there, I spoke to some other friends well-versed in web development on trying to handle my callbacks
              more efficiently, and a few other questions on CSS that I didn't quite understand. Something that my friends managed to help me out with is that whenever Typed.js finished animating typing
              a line, the cursor would remain and blink. I ended up having to select the span and removing some CSS classes from it. I then finished up some work on my project. It's small but you can find it <a href="final_project/">here.</a>
