        Occasionally, I like to take a stroll around Pittsburgh. While there may not be much greenery at Pitt (aside from the Schenley Quad and the Cathedral Lawn), there is quite a bit to be found at Schenley Park down the road. 
        While I'm there, much of my time is taken admiring the scenery and analyzing the different kinds of flora and fauna that I see. With that being said, it probably isn't too much of a surprise that I chose a dataset about the different kind of trees to talk about for this project.

        Nature is something that isn't as static as we would like to think it is. Much like people, animals, and diseases, flora and fauna tend to spread and move across the globe. Whether this be through exchange through arboretums, 
        exchange facilitated by human necessity (exchange of plants and trees producing specific vegetables and fruits, perhaps), or maybe even by accident, we see a large number of trees and plants around us that may not have always been there.
        My objective for today is to see what trees are indeed indigenous to Pittsburgh, and then see if the population is more biased towards those species or towards the introduced trees.
        However, let's start by taking a look at the trees that are indigenous to Pennsylvania, and just how many there are now.

        After a quick google search, you'll find that many websites in fact don't have much information on what trees are indigenous to PA and which aren't. Some websites will state that there are only around 4-10 trees that originated in PA <sup>1</sup>, while others state that there are over 40 <sup>2</sup>. 
        However, through these websites we can definitely find common ground. For the most part, it appears that Pine trees and Balsam Firs are agreed to be indigenous to PA as a whole, while other common finds were Maple and Oak trees.

        However, that's not really why we're here. All we care about is Pittsburgh, and no where else. Thankfully, there is a Popular Pittsburgh article that talks about trees commonly found in Pittsburgh<sup>3</sup>, but not particularly ones that are indigenous to Pittsburgh. However, we can correlate the 
        one mentioned in the Popular Pittsburgh article to the trees listed in the previous articles to find which trees are (or at least have a high probability of being) indigenous to Pittsburgh. With that strategy in mind, here are a few trees that are indigenous to Pittsburgh:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Birch trees</li>
        <li>Dogwood trees</li>
        <li>Maple trees</li>
        <li>Pine Trees</li>
        <li>Sycamore Trees</li>
        <li>Eastern Hemlock Trees</li>
        <li>White Oak Trees</li>
        <li>Elm Trees</li> 
    </ul>
    <p>
        Interestingly enough, the only trees that were on the Popular Pittsburgh list but weren't on the inaturalist website<sup>2</sup> were the Tree of Heaven and Poplar trees. The Tree of Heaven is a tree that has been introduced to PA, and is wreaking havoc on many an ecosystem here (fun fact, the computer science class called 
        "Introduction to Computer Game Design" actually started as a way to train potential grad students in special skills that would be useful when working on a project to monitor the Tree of Heaven population in the US). Poplar trees are more interesting, particularly because they are indigenous to the northern hemisphere and I've seen many
        when wandering parks in Philadelphia, so it was a surprise not to see them included in the trees indigenous to PA.

        Alright, now that we have an idea on what kind of trees are indigenous to Pittsburgh, let's take a look at what the dataset that I found (courtesy of the City of Pittsburgh Department of Public Works Forestry Division). The dataset itself is very detailed, with many different measures and dimensions that we could look at. We could look
        at the land use, Carbon Dioxide Benefits, and a variety of other different points, but the only thing of interest to us is the count of each type of tree that this data set has. After plugging it into Tableau, this is what we get:

        There's quite a bit to extract from this, despite it being such a simple bar graph. Right off the bat, we can definitely see a large presence of Maple trees in the dataset,
